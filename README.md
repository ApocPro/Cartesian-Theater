Pure Data patches for manipulating sound and visual with EEG.  The files are in no particular order. 

This collection of ideas was used for a few installations and performances 5 years ago.  It used a Mattel MindFlex, Open Sound Control, and PureData to create a performative Brainwave system.

The system was niave at the time and was just the start of a much bigger concept.  I programmed a number of tricks to sonify the brainwave that at the time functioned and created a unique experience, but there were some fundamental flaws in the system, not the least of which was using a Barbie dry EEG sensor on the frontal cortex that barely sent out information that was differential from surface noice of the skin.

This project was a spring board into **Brain Strike**, a 2 person game of Risk based on your concentration levels (Repository can be found on my bitbucket).  At this point I moved away from Pd and started building everything in Python.  

During the Brain Strike project the hardware limits of the Mattel MindFlex became very apparent and I have moved into the OpenBCI platform.

This was a fun experiment and totally worth the learnings, but future projects are being worked on in Max, Python, and OpenBCI instead of this format.
